# Cyber Security Internship – Task 8

## 📌 Task Title
SQL Injection Practical Exploitation

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQLMap
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- XAMPP (Windows)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand SQL Injection vulnerabilities and demonstrate how automated tools can exploit insecure database interactions in a controlled lab environment.

## 📚 Task Overview
This task focuses on identifying and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities using SQLMap.  
The target application used was DVWA, hosted locally using XAMPP, ensuring that all testing was performed ethically and legally.

The task involved:
- Identifying injectable parameters
- Automating SQL Injection exploitation using SQLMap
- Enumerating databases and tables
- Extracting user data
- Analyzing security impact
- Suggesting mitigation techniques

## 🧪 Testing Environment
- Operating System: Windows
- Web Server: Apache (XAMPP)
- Database: MySQL
- Vulnerable Application: DVWA
- Exploitation Tool: SQLMap

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Understanding how SQL Injection works
- Using SQLMap for automated vulnerability exploitation
- Enumerating databases and extracting sensitive data
- Assessing the impact of database security flaws
- Importance of secure coding practices

## 🛡 Mitigation Techniques Learned
- Use of prepared statements and parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database access
- Disabling detailed database error messages
- Regular security testing and monitoring

## ✅ Learning Outcome
- Strong understanding of SQL Injection exploitation
- Practical experience with SQLMap
- Improved awareness of database security risks
- Ability to analyze and document attack impact professionally

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All testing was conducted on a deliberately vulnerable application in a local lab environment for educational purposes only. No real-world systems were tested.
